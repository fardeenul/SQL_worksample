This was part of my SQL syntax to the LinkedIn Learning course 'SQL Essential Learning'

✔I was tasked to select particular columns from different tables

SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy FROM Country ORDER BY Name;
SELECT Name, LifeExpectancy AS "Life Expectancy" FROM Country ORDER BY Name;

✔Then, filtered results using WHERE and ORDER BY

SELECT Name, Continent, Region FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Europe' ORDER BY Name LIMIT 5;
SELECT Name, Continent, Region FROM Country WHERE Continent = 'Europe' ORDER BY Name LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;

✔In a particular table, I had to insert new information usign INSERT function
INSERT INTO customer (name, address, city, state, zip) 
  VALUES ('Fred Flintstone', '123 Cobblestone Way', 'Bedrock', 'CA', '91234');

INSERT INTO customer (name, city, state) 
  VALUES ('Jimi Hendrix', 'Renton', 'WA');

✔Updated information from an existing table

UPDATE customer SET address = '123 Music Avenue', zip = '98056' WHERE id = 5;
UPDATE customer SET address = '2603 S Washington St', zip = '98056' WHERE id = 5;
UPDATE customer SET address = NULL, zip = NULL WHERE id = 5;

✔Deleting Data for customers who was no longer had business with the company

SELECT * FROM customer WHERE id = 4;
DELETE FROM customer WHERE id = 4;
SELECT * FROM customer;
DELETE FROM customer WHERE id = 5;
SELECT * FROM customer;

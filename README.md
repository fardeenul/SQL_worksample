# SQL Essential Learning
This GitHub repository contains my solutions and practice exercises from the LinkedIn Learning course 'SQL Essential Learning'. The course focuses on developing fundamental skills in SQL (Structured Query Language) for data manipulation and retrieval.

Key Features:

    Selecting Specific Columns: I practiced selecting particular columns from different tables, retrieving data such as names and life expectancies from the 'Country' table. I also explored the use of aliases to rename columns.

    Filtering and Sorting Results: I learned how to filter results using the WHERE clause, selecting data from the 'Country' table where the continent is 'Europe'. I further refined the queries by using the ORDER BY clause to sort the results in ascending order of the country name. I also explored pagination using the LIMIT and OFFSET keywords.

    Data Insertion: I practiced inserting new information into a table using the INSERT statement. I added customer details, such as name, address, city, state, and zip, to the 'customer' table.

    Data Update: I learned how to update existing data in a table using the UPDATE statement. I modified customer information, such as address and zip code, based on specific conditions like customer ID.

    Data Deletion: I explored the DELETE statement to remove data from the 'customer' table. I deleted records for customers who were no longer associated with the company based on their ID.

This GitHub repository serves as a collection of SQL queries and code snippets showcasing my understanding and practice with SQL syntax and data manipulation techniques.
